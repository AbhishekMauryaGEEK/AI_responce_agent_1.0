🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Create a virtual environment & activate

bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Linux/Mac
source .venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure your API keys

Copy config/example.env to .env (do not commit .env).

Add your Google API key and Search Engine ID.

See setup in src/tools/web_search.py for required variables.

🖥️ Running the Streamlit App
bash
streamlit run scripts/app.py
💡 Usage Notes
You must provide your own API keys for web search/summarization.

Data, models, and results are ignored in git—add your own files locally.

Use example configs as templates—never commit real secrets.
